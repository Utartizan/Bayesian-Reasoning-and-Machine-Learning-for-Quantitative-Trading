Basics of probability: discrete and continuous distributions (normal, log-normal, etc.).

Bayesian updating: updating probabilities of price movements based on new data (e.g., signals, news).

Monte Carlo simulations: estimating probabilities of outcomes (e.g., probability of hitting a price target).

Hidden Markov Models (HMM): modelling market regimes (bull, bear, sideways).
